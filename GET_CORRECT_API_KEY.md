## 🚨 Still Getting "Public Key is Invalid" Error

Your current key `RMqzcUrLOqFJ82oqb` is still not working.

## ✅ Step-by-Step to Get Correct Public Key:

### Method 1: EmailJS Dashboard
1. **Go to**: [https://dashboard.emailjs.com/](https://dashboard.emailjs.com/)
2. **Login** to your account
3. **Click**: "Account" in the left sidebar
4. **Click**: "General" tab
5. **Look for**: "Public Key" section
6. **Copy**: The entire public key (should be longer)

### Method 2: If You Can't Find It
1. **Go to**: [https://dashboard.emailjs.com/admin/account](https://dashboard.emailjs.com/admin/account)
2. **Login** if prompted
3. **Look for**: "Public Key" or "User ID"
4. **Copy**: The key that starts with `user_`

### Method 3: Create New Account (If Needed)
If you can't find the key or it's still not working:
1. **Create new EmailJS account**: [https://www.emailjs.com/](https://www.emailjs.com/)
2. **Get new public key** from the new account
3. **Update the code** with the new key

## 🔍 What a Valid Public Key Looks Like:

**Format Examples:**
- `user_abc123xyz789def456ghi012jkl345mno`
- `user_1a2b3c4d5e6f7g8h9i0j1k2l3m4n5o6p`
- `user_xyz789abc123def456ghi012jkl345mno`

**Characteristics:**
- ✅ Starts with `user_`
- ✅ Usually 25-40+ characters long
- ✅ Contains letters and numbers
- ❌ NOT just random letters like `RMqzcUrLOqFJ82oqb`

## 🚀 Quick Test:

1. **Get the correct public key** from EmailJS dashboard
2. **Update line 114** in `script.js`:
   ```javascript
   publicKey: 'user_YOUR_ACTUAL_LONG_KEY_HERE'
   ```
3. **Save the file**
4. **Refresh your website**
5. **Test the contact form**

## 📧 Alternative: Check Your EmailJS Account

**Make sure you're logged into the RIGHT EmailJS account:**
- The account where you created the service `service_s2insp8`
- The account where you created the template `template_qgp35tb`
- The account that has the correct public key

## 🔧 If Still Not Working:

**Try this simple test:**
1. Create a completely new EmailJS account
2. Add a Gmail service
3. Create a simple template
4. Get the new public key
5. Update all three IDs in your code

**The key must start with `user_` and be much longer than what you currently have!** 🔑
