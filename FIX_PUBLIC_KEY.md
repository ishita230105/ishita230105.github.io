# 🔑 Fix EmailJS Public Key Issue

## 🚨 Problem Identified: Invalid Public Key

The browser console shows: **"The Public Key is invalid"**

Your current public key `Y7GRL7nldIkn1u3t0` is not working.

## ✅ Solution: Get the Correct Public Key

### Step 1: Go to EmailJS Dashboard
1. Open [https://dashboard.emailjs.com/](https://dashboard.emailjs.com/)
2. Log in to your account

### Step 2: Get Your Public Key
1. Click on **"Account"** tab in the left sidebar
2. Click on **"General"** 
3. Look for **"Public Key"** section
4. **Copy the entire public key** (it should be much longer than what you have)

### Step 3: Update Your Code
1. Open `script.js` file
2. Find line 114: `publicKey: 'YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY'`
3. Replace `'YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY'` with your actual public key from step 2

**Example:**
```javascript
publicKey: 'user_abc123xyz789...' // Your actual long public key
```

### Step 4: Test the Form
1. Save the file
2. Refresh your website
3. Try submitting the contact form
4. Check browser console for success messages

## 🔍 What Your Public Key Should Look Like:

- **Length**: Usually 20-40 characters long
- **Format**: Starts with `user_` followed by random characters
- **Example**: `user_abc123xyz789def456ghi012jkl345mno`

## ❌ Common Mistakes:

1. **Copying wrong key**: Make sure you're copying the PUBLIC KEY, not service ID or template ID
2. **Missing characters**: Make sure you copy the entire key
3. **Extra spaces**: Don't add spaces when copying
4. **Wrong quotes**: Use single quotes `'` around the key

## 🚀 After Fixing:

Once you update the public key correctly, you should see:
- ✅ Console message: "Email sent successfully"
- ✅ Form shows success message
- ✅ Email arrives in your inbox

## 📧 Still Having Issues?

If you can't find your public key:
1. Make sure you're logged into the correct EmailJS account
2. Check if you have multiple accounts
3. Try creating a new EmailJS account if needed
